const letterMock = `My Dearest

Much like an unexpected second life, meeting you felt like finding a new path I never knew existed. You are my calm in storms, my laughter in quiet halls, and the gentle push that helps me grow.

I promise to be your companion on every small adventure â€” to learn with you, to joke with you, and to make even the ordinary feel magical.

The one who is always right,
Dhura`;
